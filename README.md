# Project 15. Around the US Backend Preparation and Deployment
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the Around the US project. The project helps to gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

This final sprint project consists of:
1. Writing code necessary for authorizing users on the server & testing routes in Postman.
2. Running the front end and back end together locally to make sure that the client side and server side of the application work together correctly. 
3. Writing centralized error handling and deploying the project to the server.

## Running the Project Locally
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature
